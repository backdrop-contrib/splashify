Overview:
---------
Splashify is a full featured splash page module that is designed to be search
engine friendly. It is originally based on the Drupal 6 Splash module. It
allows you to specify a page to be displayed anywhere on your site, using one
of a few different delivery options (redirect, popup window or Colorbox). The
module also provides options specific to mobile devices.

The main focus of this module is the following:
- Be search engine friendly by redirecting via JavaScript (when applicable).
- Allow specific options for mobile devices.
- Use Colorbox for displaying the splas page as a lightbox.


Installation:
-------------
1. Download the jStorage jquery library and place the files in this folder:
   sites/all/libraries/jstorage/

2. Download and unpack the Splashify module directory in your modules folder
   (this will usually be "sites/all/modules/").

Colorbox module: http://drupal.org/project/colorbox .
